# brand_analytics_automation
In this project I am trying to automate to download the Amazon Search Terms according search terms using seller's account.


### PROJECT STRUCTURE

* search_amazon_seller.py

#### HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT
----
*Before running the script make sure to create the python file credentials.py where put your credentials.py or just copy all from credentials.example and put the username and password*


    python search_amazon_seller.py

It will automatically add the login with your user account but due to complexity you need to manually type the OPT code that will be sent to your registered number like this

You mean to manally add the OTP code. Sometimes we may need to solve the captcha text and re enter the pass. Once Solving it we may type c in our terminal from where we have run our python script




After typing c it will again continue our code.
